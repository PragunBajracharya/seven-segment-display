This project is a web-based Seven Segment Display simulator built using Next.js. It offers a visual way to learn and understand bit manipulation concepts by simulating the behavior of each segment in the display using bitwise operations.

## Features

- **Single Digit Display**: Simulates a single-digit seven-segment display.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can input numbers (0-9) to view them displayed on the virtual seven-segment display.
- **Bit Manipulation Learning**: Uses bitwise operations to control individual segments, providing a simple and interactive way to learn bit manipulation.
- **Customizable Design**: The segment colors, shapes, and sizes are customizable via CSS.
- **Responsive Layout**: The display adjusts for various screen sizes
